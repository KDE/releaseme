THE ULTIMATE EXTRAGEAR RELEASE SCRIPT

=================
Documentation
=================

* Install rdoc
* Run rdoc
* Find documentation about the various methods in doc/

Basics for lib/*:
core.rb => generic stuff used all over the place
starter.rb => wrapper that invokes everything depending on arguments
optparser.rb => option parser
*.rb => logical method groups

=================
Getting Started
=================

* Create a release_script directory in your source
* SVN external the lib directory
  * svn propset svn:externals lib https://svn.kde.org/home/kde/trunk/KDE/kdesdk/scripts/extragear-release-script/lib
* Copy template.rb to your release_script directory (e.g. as amarok.rb)
* Edit the template.rb at will
* The custom method is used between the source fetching (source, l10n, doc...)
  and the creation of the tarball for cleanup or automatic version updates

Examples can be found in Amarok's and Digikam's source tree.

=================
Usage
=================

* --help
* Tagging is off by default to prevent accidental tagging
* Any setting be manipulated via $options in your personal script
  * $options = {:tag=>true}
  * This would turn tagging on by default
* If you don't provide username, protocol, branch etc. via arguments kdialog
  will be used to query those information. It is recommendable to hardcode these
  in your script, especially if there is a designated release dude.
* In case you don't want to hardcode them into the script itself you can also
  wrap the script itself into another script that is not under version control.
  e.g. release.rb which just includes the $options variable and a require to
  (for example) amarok.rb. This of course only works if $options is not set in
  amarok.rb as well

=================
Config File
=================
Can be used \o/
 => Must be named NAMErc (e.g. amarokrc)
 => Must contain a main group (i.e. [main])
 => May manipulate anything argumentable

Example:
cat amarokrc
[main]
branch=stable
version=1.0

This will still very protocol and username though :)

Note:
Argument > Config > Default
