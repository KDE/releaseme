on dep and repo freeze day:
 - e-mail out list of repos you plan to package
 - call for features list and ask for etherpad notes e.g. https://notes.kde.org/p/plasma_5_15

on Monday before beta tar day:
 - make announcement
 - on feature release make an errata page and ask people to add bugs https://community.kde.org/Plasma/5.1_Errata
 - Ping Michael@TUXVIDEO and The Linux Experiment <t.linuxexperiment@gmail.com> to ask for videos

on beta tar day:
 - set QT_MIN_VERSION to version agreed at cycle kickoff (except plasma-browser-integration)
 - set KF5_MIN_VERSION to version agreed at cycle kickoff
 - TODO check out Harald's plasma-update-versions-kf5 to see if it works for the above

on tar day tar:
 update VERSIONS.inc
 run ./plasma-git-repos to update list of things to package in git-repositories-for-release
 run ./plasma-update-versions (ensure it is using the right branches)
 run ./plasma-tars script to make tars
      [or run the job on xenon http://xenon.pangea.pub/job/plasma-releaseme-tars/ then ./plasma-xenon-download]
 run ./plasma-upload
 check tmp-tests output for important differences
 run ./plasma-update-1-tar as needed for problems/late updates # TODO make this print out git log changes
 [upload to upload.kde.org and tell sysadmins to make tars available to packagers if you do not have permission]

on beta tar day branch:
 on a new 5.x release make branches Plasma/5.x after making the tars:
  run ./plasma-branch
  edit ./plasma-update-versions to override versions to set 5.x.80 and run it for master
  Update build.kde.org CI https://community.kde.org/Infrastructure/Continuous_Integration_System#Updating_builds_on_switching_the_.22stable.22_branch
    Increse kde:kde-build-metadata/logical-module-structure top use new branch Plasma/5.x and build that branch in build.kde.org
    Trigger build.kde.org to update build setups to latest kde-build-metadata info:
      https://build.kde.org/job/Administration/job/DSL%20Job%20Seed/
    When above has completed start global rebuild
      https://build.kde.org/view/CI%20Management/job/Global%20Rebuild%20Plasma%20kf5-qt5%20SUSEQt5.10/
      https://build.kde.org/view/CI%20Management/job/Global%20Rebuild%20Plasma%20kf5-qt5%20FreeBSDQt5.10/
  build.kde.org CI: log in, switch to "CI Management", run "DSL Job Seed" to make sure any latest build-metadata is picked up,
      once done trigger "Global Rebuild Plasma stable*" builds, which will first update dependencies to latest needs and then
      trigger rebuild of any modules
  ping tosky and kde-i18n-doc@kde.org list to branch messages and docmessages and update repo-metadata
  Update https://community.kde.org/Plasma/Live_Images
 
on tar day prepare:
 run ./plasma-changelog (manually edit file after)
   [or run xenon job http://xenon.pangea.pub/job/plasma-releaseme-changelog/ then ./plasma-xenon-download-changelog]
 Run ./update-web-svn
 run ./plasma-webpages and check over output opened in firefox
 run optipng on any new images
 run ./plasma-add-bugzilla-versions to update bugzilla version numbers (needs curl installed and may need bugzilla-cookies.inc updated)
 tell release-team@kde.org, plasma-devel@kde.org, kde-announce@kde.org
 tell vdg on forum about announce and get feedback

on release day launch:
 ./plasma-tag to push tags
 ./update-web-svn
 ./plasma-release
 this will open tabs in firefox and kate: check the web pages are good, e-mail out the texts, post the social media bits
 check if www/images/teaser teaser image needs an update
 for feature release schedule a kickoff meeting for next feature release for scheduling and feature planning
 for beta releases also copy announce to 5.x.0 page and ask for translations
 Update https://www.kde.org/screenshots/index.php for new version
 Update https://kde.org/plasma-desktop for new version
 ./plasma-tag-test to check the tags are really pushed
    or run http://xenon.pangea.pub/job/plasma-releaseme-tags-test/ to check tags are really pushed

 [tell a KDE neon person to update forks/base-files to show new version before running 'plasma-rebuild -p' and making ISOs]

TODO:
 remove apt from plasma-release
 update-web-svn has hardcoded paths src/www
 check .sig matches the key in VERSION
 test gpg works with agent before running plasma-tag
 test tag has been pushed
 pkgdiff output https://lvc.github.io/pkgdiff/
 for 5.16.90 the release_data file had the kscreen info duplicated info libkscreen, why?
 block running plasma-release unless plasma-tags-test has been run
