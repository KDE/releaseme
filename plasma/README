Check for build failures on CI:
 http://build.kde.org/view/Plasma%205%20stable/
or for a new version
 http://build.kde.org/view/Plasma%205%20master/

Check for critical bugs:

Start off by making tars (from master for first beta or from branch for later versions)

on tar day tar:
 update VERSIONS.inc
 run ./plasma-update-versions (ensure it is using the right branches)
 review plasma-tars script
 run ./plasma-tars script to make tars
 run ./plasma-upload
 check tmp-tests output for important differences
 run ./plasma-update-1-tar as needed for problems/late updates
 [upload to upload.kde.org and tell sysadmins to make tars available to packagers if you don't have permission]

on tar day branch:
 on a new 5.x release make branches Plasma/5.x after making the tars:
  run ./plasma-branch
  ensure translations are switched to correct branch in projects.kde.org and ping tosky or kde-doc-i18n list to branch messages and docmessages
  update versions directly in and run ./plasma-update-versions to set 5.x.90 in master

 branch plasma-workspace-wallpapers:
  export VERSION=5.2
  svn mkdir svn+ssh://svn@svn.kde.org/home/kde/branches/plasma/${VERSION} -m
  svn copy svn+ssh://svn@svn.kde.org/home/kde/trunk/KDE/plasma-workspace-wallpapers/ svn+ssh://svn@svn.kde.org/home/kde/branches/plasma/${VERSION}/plasma-workspace-wallpapers/ -m "branch for ${VERSION}"

on tar day prepare:
 run plasma-changelog (manually edit file after)
 run plasma-webpages, tidy up and commit for  www/announcements/plasma-5.x.y.php  www/info/plasma-5.x.y.php
 ask devs for screenshots and list of features
 on feature release make an errata page and ask people to add bugs https://community.kde.org/Plasma/5.1_Errata 
 write a Dot story
 run plasma-add-bugzilla-versions to update bugzilla version numbers (needs curl installed and may need bugzilla-cookies.inc updated)
 tell release-team@kde.org, plasma-devel@kde.org

on release day tag pre-launch:
 chmod 755 the directory on depot (or ask sysadmin if you don't have permission)
 tag by copying 5.x.y-release-data to release_data and running tagme
 tag plasma-workspace-wallpapers:
  svn copy svn+ssh://svn@svn.kde.org/home/kde/branches/plasma/5.1/plasma-workspace-wallpapers/ svn+ssh://svn@svn.kde.org/home/kde/tags/plasma-workspace-wallpapers/5.1.2 -m "Tagging 5.1.2"


on release day launch:
 remove non-release notice and update date in www/announcements/plasma-5.x.y.php and www/info/plasma-5.x.y.php
 www/announcements/index.php
 www/announcements/release_data.php
 www/index.php
 publish Dot story on front page
 e-mail kde-announce@kde.org
 post on twitter, g+, facebook, reddit (r/kde and r/linux)
 e-mail release-team@kde.org, plasma-devel@kde.org with the happy news

TODO
 in plasma-changelog escape HTML tags
 in plasma-update-1-tar get a diff to the old tar
